## ABOUT ME !

nick(olas) / calicosgrave

he/it -- 18 -- taken -- EST -- INFP

audhd, among other things!! -- semi-speaking
-- -- --
interaction of (most) kinds is perfectly okay! whispers are kinda iffy, but for a small question or two it doesn't bother me any ^^

i'm usually on the safe server, likely at docks, but i can be found in other places as well!

-- i suffer from (mostly) involuntary age regression, and occasionally play this to help regulate myself! this leads to me primarily using short sentences/phrases rather than full sentences, or only using "body" language (emotes, expressions, etc)!

-- i may appear shy or awkward, but for the most part i'm fully comfortable! just sorta quiet ^^

<summary>media i like!</summary>

- my little pony, primarily g4 but i like the older generations as well, just don't interact with the content very much!

- warrior cats (1st-5th arc, i read maybe half of arc 6 LOL), especially worldbuilding/oc related content!

- spongebob, especially the older seasons!! my favorite episode is culture shock/F.U.N. (s1ep10) :D

- pokemon! i'm sorta new to the fandom, but i've loved its worldbuilding and biology/creature designs since i was super young ^^
